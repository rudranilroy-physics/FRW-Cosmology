# Numerical Cosmology

## Age of the Universe
Age of the FRW universe can be calculated using the jula code **age_frw.jl**.
#### Input
n (*Enter the number of steps :*) = Number of Steps : The interval will be divided into **n** equal sub-intervals, and the integration will be calculated using **Composite Simpson's 1/3 rule**.
a (*The value of a for which the age will be calculated :*) = The value of a(t) : The input will take an input the value of **a** and the program will calculate the value of corresponding **t**.
